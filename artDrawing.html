                <h2>Foira - League of Legends</h2>
                <p>One of my most detailed drawings, featuring fiora, a champion from League of Legends. This one also took the longest to create.</p>

                  <h2>Sand Hunter</h2>
                  <p>While this drawing is slightly undetailed, it was fun to make and has an interesting atmosphere.</p>

                  <h2>Nord</h2>
                  <p>This piece was going to be one of many, but I lost inspiration, so there is only one. However, I am happy with the one I did finish.</p>

                  <h2>Snow</h2>
                  <p>One of my favorite pieces, not for its high detail, or skillfull use of perspective, but its ability to create the feeling of cold, and the beauty in it.</p>
                </a>

                  <h2>Void Tree</h2>
                  <p>This is one of the more detailed pieces and took me quite a while. The final result was not quite what I had planned it to be, but I think it still is quite interesting.</p>

                  <p>This piece was inspired by sinixdesign, where you go to the mapcrush website and then draw the random landscape.</p>
